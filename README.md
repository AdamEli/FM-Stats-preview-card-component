## My process

### Built with

-   Semantic HTML5 markup
-   CSS custom properties
-   Flexbox
-   Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned about how to use the picture tag in order to change the picture based on screen size. I also learned how to make the image work responsively and not stretch by using the object fit property.

### Continued development

I want to continue working with images that need to change based on screen size because it is currently challenging for me. I also want to improve on writing accessible and semantic code.

### Useful resources

-   [Example resource 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yAAV-uP0po) - This helped me for learn how to use the object fit property.

Tyrell Curry was very helpful in the Slack channel, he helped me with the image and how to change the color. He showed me how to use filters, which did the trick!
